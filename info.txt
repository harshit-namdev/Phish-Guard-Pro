# PhishGuard Pro - Comprehensive Project Information

## Project Overview
PhishGuard Pro is an advanced browser extension designed to protect users from phishing attacks, malicious websites, and online threats. It combines multiple detection techniques including URL analysis, content scanning, and pattern recognition to provide comprehensive security while browsing the web.

## Core Technologies
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Chrome Extensions API (Manifest V3)
- Google Safe Browsing API
- Pattern-based URL and content analysis
- Asynchronous background processing
- Local storage for data persistence

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-layered Security Analysis
- Real-time URL scanning using Google Safe Browsing API
- Pattern-based URL analysis to detect suspicious characteristics
- Optional website content scanning for phishing indicators
- Blacklist integration for known malicious domains

### 2. User-Customizable Protection
- Whitelist and blacklist management for trusted and blocked domains
- Adjustable sensitivity levels (Low, Medium, High)
- Toggleable features (auto-blocking, notifications, content scanning)
- User feedback system for reporting false positives

### 3. User-Friendly Interface
- Modern, intuitive UI with tabbed navigation
- Visual status indicators and color-coded warnings
- Comprehensive threat information display
- Easy access to security settings and history

### 4. Monitoring and Reporting
- Threat history logging and management
- API health monitoring for reliable protection
- Statistics tracking for scanned and blocked URLs
- Phishing reporting capability to external services

## Technical Architecture

### Background Service
- Handles URL analysis and security checks
- Manages communication with external APIs
- Maintains whitelist/blacklist and settings
- Monitors API health status

### Content Scripts
- Scan page content for suspicious patterns
- Monitor form submissions for potential data theft
- Highlight dangerous links with visual indicators
- Analyze email content for phishing attempts

### User Interface Components
- Popup interface for user interaction
- Warning pages for detected threats
- Settings management interface
- Whitelist/blacklist management

### Data Management
- Local storage for user preferences
- Threat history logging
- Whitelist and blacklist persistence
- API health status tracking

## Implementation Details

### URL Analysis Process
1. URL is intercepted during navigation
2. Whitelist/blacklist check is performed
3. Google Safe Browsing API query is executed
4. Pattern-based analysis is applied
5. Security score is calculated based on multiple factors
6. Action is taken based on security score and user settings

### Content Analysis Process
1. Page content is scanned after loading
2. Suspicious patterns are identified (login forms, hidden elements, etc.)
3. Risk score is calculated based on detected patterns
4. User is alerted if risk threshold is exceeded

### User Feedback Loop
1. Users can report false positives
2. Feedback is stored locally
3. Domains can be added to whitelist to prevent future blocking
4. Settings can be adjusted based on user experience

## Security Considerations
- All sensitive API keys should be properly secured
- No personal browsing data is transmitted or stored externally
- Local storage is used for all user data
- Permissions are limited to only what's necessary for functionality
- Warning pages are designed to prevent accidental navigation to dangerous sites

## Future Development Opportunities
- Machine learning-based detection for improved accuracy
- Additional API integrations for enhanced threat detection
- Browser fingerprinting protection
- Password strength monitoring
- Secure DNS configuration
- Anti-tracking capabilities
- Encrypted connection verification
